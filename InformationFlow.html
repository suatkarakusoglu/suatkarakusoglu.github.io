<p>
This week I encountered an intriguing paper by <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/friedrich-hayek/">F.A. Hayek</a>, <b><a href="https://fee.org/articles/the-use-of-knowledge-in-society/">The Use Of Knowledge In Society</a></b>.
I would like to summarize my thoughts about the subject in a small post.
</p>

<p>
The paper talks about how the information in the universe is dispersed and the dynamism surrounding us would disallow centralization from the beginning.
</p>

<section id="outline-container-org2dc6d00" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2dc6d00">Information and Planning</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2dc6d00">
<p>
Hayek&rsquo;s definition of planning was the clearest one I have heard.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;The complex of interrelated decisions about the allocation of our available resources.&rdquo;
&#x2014; Hayek
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Also, he continues explaining:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The problem is precisely how to extend the span of our utilization of resources beyond the span of the control of any one mind; and, therefore, how to dispense with the need of conscious control and how to provide inducements which will make the individuals do the desirable things without anyone having to tell them what to do.
&#x2014; Hayek
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Even though the paper talks about the dispersion of knowledge and the implications of this fact in economic wise,
I believe we have been feeling the effects of distributed knowledge in technology.

<h2 id="org83557bd">IT Relevancy of Knowledge Dispersion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org83557bd">
<p>
Generally speaking, the <b>IT</b> acronym stands for &rsquo;Information Technology&rsquo; and this Information and Technology amalgam has filled all the gaps in our daily lives.
</p>

<p>
Informations&rsquo; word origin relies latine on In-<b>form</b>-ation which is giving <b>form</b> to something -&gt; shaping -&gt; educating -&gt; instructing.
</p>

<p>
So in its inner meaning, Information is the communication of knowledge between more than one party that shapes each other&rsquo;s behaviors and then states.
</p>

<p>
Controlling the big bunch of knowledge and the flow can be daunting and much complex.
</p>

<p>
Internal decision mechanisms get more complex with additional business rules.
</p>

<p>
Conway&rsquo;s law about the companies and their management structure similarity also applies to the micro services.
</p>

<p>
Knowledge management gets partitioned into small services, which each of them has its own states about the currently demanded job.
</p>

<p>
Each small process with its own decisions and helps the overall task to finish.
</p>

<p>
This distribution of information and the separation of the duties are providing better ways to manage the system.

<h2 id="orge331eaa">Notes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge331eaa">
<p>
You may never reach the truest information. That&rsquo;s against nature.
</p>

<p>
Micro decisions are the macro blocks of the current situations.
</p>

<p>
Decisions you will be taking can not be broader than the information you have.
</p>

<p>
Seek for enough information that will help to realize your goals.
</p>

<p>
Seek for the optimum solution based on your space and time constraints.
</p>

<p>
Wikipedia&rsquo;s which is the biggest distributed knowledge repository founder Jimmy&rsquo;s inspiration was also this very paper.
