      <description>We will talk about dired mode and the features showing examples.
Processes are pretty much everything which works under the hood of the operating system.
Sometimes you may get pretty furious about some processes which are stuck , which prevents you, by holding on to ports and doesnâ€™t allow you to start new processes, that is why you wanna kill, not because you are insane.
This term may seem brutal but, every killing opens opportunity for new born pretty processes.</description>
