<p>
This week I encountered an intriguing paper by F.A. Hayek, <b>The Use Of Knowledge In Society</b>.
I would like to summarize my thoughts about the subject in a small post.
</p>

<p>
The paper talks about how the information in the universe is dispersed and centralization of it impossible. The dynamism surrounding us would disallow it from the beginning.
</p>

<p>
Even though the paper talks about dispersion of knowledge and the implications of this fact in economic wise, i believe we have been feeling the affects of these dynamically generated information and results of it all around us.
</p>

<section id="outline-container-org9f9ff53" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org9f9ff53">IT Relevancy of Knowledge Dispersion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9f9ff53">
<p>
Generally speaking, the <b>IT</b> acronym stands for &rsquo;Information Technology&rsquo; and this Information and Technology amalgam has filled all the gaps in our daily lives.
</p>

<p>
Informations&rsquo; word origin relies latine on In-<b>form</b>-ation which is giving <b>form</b> to something -&gt; shaping -&gt; educating -&gt; instructing.
</p>

<p>
So in its inner meaning, Information is communication of knowledge between more then one party that shapes each other&rsquo;s behaviours and then states.

<h2 id="org2cff816">Information and Planning</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2cff816">
<p>
Hayek&rsquo;s definition on planning was the clearest one i have heard.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;The complex of interrelated decisions about the allocation of our available resources.&rdquo;
&#x2014; Hayek
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Also he continues explaining:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;We must show how a solution is produced by the interactions of people each of whom possesses only partial knowledge. To assume all the knowledge to be given to a single mind in the same manner in which we assume it to be given to us as the explaining economists is to assume the problem away and to disregard everything that is important and significant in the real world.&rdquo;
&#x2014; Hayek

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org368353d">
<p>
You may never reach the truest information. That&rsquo;s against the nature.
</p>

<p>
Micro decisions are the macro blocks of the current situations.
</p>

<p>
Decisions you will be taking can not be broader than the information you have.
</p>

<p>
Seek for the enough information that will help realizing your goals.
</p>

<p>
Seek for the optimum solution based on your space and time constraints.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org91c9eac">
<p>
That claim also proved itself by the fact that the biggest knowledge repository is distributed and called Wikipedia.
</p>

<p>
Wikipedia&rsquo;s founder Jimmy&rsquo;s inspiration was also this very paper.
